**Motivation**
The project was built for a university project. We were asked to develop an airline reservation system. We chose Take Off as our website name and we developed both the frontend and backend of the web application.

**Build Status**

**Code Style**

The React part of the code (front end) uses class components most of the time. Functional components were used sometimes to be able to use react router and pass props from component to another.

**Screenshots**

As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.
